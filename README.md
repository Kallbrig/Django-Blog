# Django-Blog
Basic Blog app created with Django.

This application was built by following the Youtube Tutorial @ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p


# What I learned
* I became more familliar with Django's ins and outs such as Models, Class based views, and Forms
* HTML is coming more quickly with the help of Bootstrap.
* I learned about Django's default behavior like naming conventions. This is exemplified in the password reset templates specifically.
* I learned about using Crispy forms to display Bootstrap-like forms.
* I used Pillow to handle uploading and resizing imanges for user profile photos.
